Medprep that asks users to input details about their signs and symptoms of sickness, along with their gender, age and location. Using computerised algorithms, the self diagnosis tool will then give a range of conditions that might fit the problems a user is experiencing. This model is used to predict symptoms that are closely related to a given symptom. It can be used in cases (read apps) where the user enters a symptom, and a list of similar symptoms pop up, of which the user can select the ones he's suffering from, and these can be further fed into a model that can then predict the disease the person is suffering from, and redirect him to the associated specialist. They can also advise someone whether to seek advice from a healthcare professional and the level of urgency in which to do so. It also suggests nearby hospitals from the userâ€™s current location.
